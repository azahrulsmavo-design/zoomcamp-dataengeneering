# LinkedIn Post Drafts for Data Engineering Zoomcamp Module 1

Here are three variations for your LinkedIn post. Choose the one that best fits your style!

## Option 1: Professional & Achievement-Oriented (Recommended)

**Excited to share that I've completed Module 1 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp by DataTalks.Club!**

This week was all about building a strong foundation with **Docker**, **SQL**, and **Terraform**. I successfully built a containerized data pipeline to ingest and analyze the NYC Green Taxi dataset.

**Technical Highlights:**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Orchestrated a local environment with Python, PostgreSQL, and PgAdmin containers.
- **Data Ingestion**: Wrote a Python script using Pandas and SQLAlchemy to efficiently load parquet data into Postgres.
- **Advanced SQL**: Ran complex queries to uncover insights like the longest daily trips and top pickup zones.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Explored Terraform workflows for managing cloud resources.

Big thanks to Alexey Grigorev and the community for this amazing course. On to Module 2!

## Option 2: Short & Sweet

Just finished Week 1 of the #DEZoomcamp!

I learned how to containerize data pipelines using **Docker**, set up a local **Postgres** database, and analyze NYC Taxi data with **SQL**. It's satisfying to see the code turn into actionable insights.

Checking Module 1 off the list and ready for Workflow Orchestration next week!

## Option 3: Detailed & Storytelling

I’ve officially started my journey into Data Engineering, and Module 1 has been a blast!

The challenge? Setting up a complete local data environment from scratch.
I used **Docker Compose** to spin up a Postgres database and PgAdmin, then wrote a **Python** script to ingest over 8,000 rows of NYC Green Taxi data.

The fun part was digging into the data with **SQL**. I answered questions like:
- *Which day had the longest trip?* (Nov 14th!)
- *Which zone had the largest tips?* (Yorkville West)

It’s great to get hands-on experience with these tools. I also brushed up on **Terraform** for infrastructure management.
